Usage:
* simulate the different models for a recurrent network example: python2 runmodels.py
* spectral models: plot/precalulate the quantities: python2 quantities_precalc_spectral.py
* cascade models: plot/precalulate the quantities: python2 quantities_precalc_cascade.py

The parameters are mainly defined in file params.py
The numerical integration of the respective models are defined in: ../models/*
The spectral solver code is contained in: ../spectralsolver


TODO: 
* rename spec2m to spec2 -- similarly for the simple version
* make example scripts for situations as in fig1 and fig4
* maybe add ipython notebooks for better relation to paper?
* maybe show some sigma filters?
* cleanup the code a lot
* improve documentation
