# fokker-planck-based-spike-rate-models
Rate models for (adaptive) integrate-and-fire models based on the Fokker-Planck eq.: (i) numerical solution of the full FP eq., (ii) low-dimensional ODE from the spectral decomposition of the FP operator, (iii) low-d. ODE through a linear-nonlinear cascade fitted to FP reponse properties and (iv) a reproduction accuracy comparison of (i)-(iii).
